- [ ] Range estimation in actual deployment conditions needs to be validated. How have you done it?
> No we havent tested in deep sea, we have tested it in a depth of 2 - meter at a 10m - 10m swimming pool.
- [ ] Have you validated the Design at Prototype level & also in Underwater environment? What are the results?
> The results are as follow:
> 
- [ ] Indicate if a protype has been developed and tested? What results have been obtained using light, RF and Acoustic signals?
> While Acoustic is the most useful in long range underwater communication, the transducers are very expensive, since we had only 50mW transmiters with us the distance was pretty narrow, For Light based 
- [ ] Which models of the underwater medium (multipath, dispersive, high attenuation to RF, dispersion of light) have been utilised in the design?
> Multipath simulation system were used to design the prototype.
- [ ] What is likely power output of the Tx borne by the diver? How do we direct energy towards the buoy / floating platform?
> The system is made using a full bridge driver, capable of expanding upto 36W. The problem with the acoustic tranducer at hand was its low bandwidth and low power output of 50mW.
> The energy transfer would be omni directional, and for long range systems laser links are also adopted.
- [ ] How the problem of Voice distortions in the under water communications is addressed.
> By going digital instead of analog ,Since we are using Lyra we are able to get high fedility audio realtime with low Bandwidth. Data is retransmitted if distortions occur in the medium
- [ ] If any proto is realized can we see a demo video?
> A Completely functional prototype has not yet been created the total, a functional prototyping video has been included
