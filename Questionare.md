- [ ] Range estimation in actual deployment conditions needs to be validated. How have you done it?
- [ ] Have you validated the Design at Prototype level & also in Underwater environment? What are the results?
- [ ] Indicate if a protype has been developed and tested? What results have been obtained using light, RF and Acoustic signals?
- [ ] Which models of the underwater medium (multipath, dispersive, high attenuation to RF, dispersion of light) have been utilised in the design?
- [ ] What is likely power output of the Tx borne by the diver? How do we direct energy towards the buoy / floating platform?
- [ ] How the problem of Voice distortions in the under water communications is addressed.
- [ ] If any proto is realized can we see a demo video?
