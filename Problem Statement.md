### Problem Statement

1.  **INTRODUCTION**
    
    To enhance the underwater communication capability between divers, ships and submarines, there is a requirement for the development of an indigenous Underwater Diver Acoustic Communication Equipment (UDACE) for Marine Commandos. To make the equipment more tactically useful and to enhance the spectrum of operation where it can be utilized, this equipment needs to be compatible with the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) on board submarines/surface ships
    
    Indian Navy is presently using hard-wired mode for diver communication, where the number of communication channels & distance are limited, along with hindrances to movement of diver. A wireless mode of communication provides more flexibility to the diver and ease of deployment. Hence it is required to develop a state-of-the-art wireless Underwater Diver Acoustic Communication Equipment (UDACE) that is compatible with the Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) on-board submarines/surface ships.
    
    The equipment should be: 
    - easily attachable to any mask; 
    - should be able to fully integrate into an existing diver communication suite; 
    - it should be equipped with an emergency mode of communication to alert other divers and base stations in case of distress; 
    - A mechanism to measure and communicate the heartbeat of the diver to base stations as a basic health monitoring system. In addition to the normal voice mode of communication, there is a requirement of throat microphone, (‘laryngophone’ that absorbs vibrations directly from the wearer's throat by way of single or dual sensors worn against the neck).

2.  **DESIRED OUTCOMES & EXPECTED BENEFITS**  
    1.  **SCOPE OF WORK**
        
        The equipment a compact and portable unit for fitment on diver’s suit made for carrying out underwater missions. The specifications for Underwater Diver Acoustic Communication Equipment (UDACE) are:  [[README#Requested Specifications]]
        
    2.  **RECENT TRENDS / STATUS OF TECHNOLOGY**
        
        The present Diver Underwater Communication System (DUCS) mostly uses a hard-line system which utilizes the “four-wire approach” even though wireless systems are available. It is a closed loop comparable to a telephone system. A typical hard-line system consists of: 
        - surface intercom 
        - head set with boom microphone set up for four wire; 
        - diver microphone/ear phone assembly;
        - mask microphone and full-face mask; and requires a physical connection between the listener and talker. The signal travels over the communication rope.
        
        Four wire communication is defined as a duplex communication route. Two wires provide the up–link signal path and two additional wires provide the down-link path. This allows everyone to be online simultaneously similar to a telephone conference call.
        
    3.  **TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENT & IMPROVEMENTS EXPECTED**
        
        The system should use advanced state of the art technology which enables the diver to use the system completely hands-free to communicate with each other and to any compatible base station equipment for various platforms. There should be provision for automatic gain and squelch control which leaves the diver hands-free for the duration of the dive. More focus is to be on the development of throat microphone which is designed to pick up (transduce) the vibrations of the vocal apparatus at the throat instead of the vibrations of air molecules at the mouth. It improves the intelligibility of voice by eliminating the noisy ambient conditions. Throat microphones make contact with the soft tissue of the throat and record vibrations from throat. **It is also advisable to study the effects of bone-conduction microphones in addition to throat microphones, and compare the results and accordingly modify design of the system** .
        
    4.  **CHALLENGES**
        
        The process of talking in underwater is influenced by the internal geometry of the life support equipment and constraints on the communications systems as well as the physical and physiological influences of the environment on the processes of speaking and vocal sound production. The use of breathing gases under pressure or containing helium causes problems in intelligibility of diver speech due to distortion caused by the different speed of sound in the gas and the different density of the gas compared to air at surface pressure. These parameters cause loss in intelligibility of sound. Also, during exhalation, more bubbles are created. Bubbles create noise, which deteriorates the quality of the sound by creating vibrations and sounds that drown out your speech. So, it is a great challenge to devise a mechanism towards the realization of a reliable Underwater Acoustic Diver Communication Equipment.
        
    5.  **APPLICATION**
        
        To use in military underwater scenario as a means to provide acoustic communication link for marine commandos to other commandos and to any compatible base station equipment of various platforms.
